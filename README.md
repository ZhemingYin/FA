## Abstract
With the emerging interest in indoor positioning, our goal is to build a millimeter wave indoor localization system based on the active radar sensing of local passive reference points which reduces costs but ensures its accuracy. However, building a real system is time-consuming and expensive, so this thesis is aiming at building a ray tracing channel simulation to easily calculate the channel impulse response (CIR) and received signal by the radar system. Meanwhile, in order to make the scene closer to the real world, we will build a larger and more complicated room model in Blender, then simulate and apply the raytracing including the anisotropic antenna radiation pattern and radar cross-section (RCS) in Matlab. Further, range-Doppler maps of the simulated baseband receive signal at different points along a moving robots trajectory are evaluated. Constant false alarm rate (CFAR) target detection is carried out and the plausibility of our simulation results is verified. The novel approach shows the range and velocity of the robot related to the targets in CFAR plot accurately and stabily.
