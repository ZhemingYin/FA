	abstract = {One of the most important tasks in radar signal processing is to reliably detect objects in the surrounding of the radar sensor. This can be done by comparing the frequency spectrum of the measured signal to a speciﬁc detection threshold. Using a constant threshold value may cause a large number of wrong object detections. Thus, so-called constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithms are used, which are able to calculate an adaptive threshold value due to the estimated noise ﬂoor. Two methods widely used in frequency modulated continuous wave radar (FMCW) systems will be presented, which diﬀer in how the noise estimation is achieved. In the ﬁrst part of this thesis the principles of both methods are explained and compared in the means of Matlab simulations. Therefore, the signal of interest is directly calculated in the intermediate frequency (IF)-Domain and distorted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Since the CFAR algorithms are adapted to a speciﬁc noise model, the detection performance should become independent of the Gaussian background noise power. In the second part the presented CFAR algorithms are tested based on measured FMCW radar signals, with the aim to detect non-moving objects.},
