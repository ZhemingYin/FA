	abstract = {To navigate reliably in indoor environments, an industrial autonomous vehicle must know its position. However, current indoor vehicle positioning technologies either lack accuracy, usability or are too expensive. Thus, we propose a novel concept called local reference point assisted active radar positioning, which is able to overcome these drawbacks. It is based on distributing passive retroreflectors in the indoor environment such that each position of the vehicle can be identified by a unique reflection characteristic regarding the reflectors. To observe these characteristics, the autonomous vehicle is equipped with an active radar system. On one hand, this paper presents the basic idea and concept of our new approach towards indoor vehicle positioning and especially focuses on the crucial placement of the reflectors. On the other hand, it also provides a proof of concept by conducting a full system simulation including the placement of the local reference points, the radar-based distance estimation and the comparison of two different positioning methods. It successfully demonstrates the feasibility of our proposed approach.},

Through the combination of simple reﬂectors and a single-channel frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, high positioning accuracy at low system cost can be achieved. Further, a multiobjective (MO) particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented that optimizes the 2D placement of radar reﬂectors in complex room settings.},

	abstract = {Radar has gained an increased popularity in daily life applications over the past decades. Radar sensors are deployed for multiple sensing purposes in e.g. cars, industrial automation, medical applications etc. Quite often, FMCW radars are utilised. Their architectural simplicity and recent developments in microwave-integrated circuits makes FMCW radars easily realisable as system-on-chip solution. Furthermore, MIMO radars are an emerging technology trend of future radar systems. Such radars offer a variety of novel applications apart from pure distance or Doppler determination. Combined with the hardware simplicity of FMCW radars, new application fields become addressable. Apart from sophisticated radar hardware, signal processing is an elementary component of every radar application. An essential goal of radar signal processing is target detection and estimation of related parameters from the radar observations. The gained parameters are the input for all subsequent processing chains. The radar signal processing is inseparably linked to the radar hardware and the application purpose. Broadband radars, i.e. radars with a large bandwidth and huge spatial aperture, offer tremendous resolution capabilities, such that classical methods to estimate target parameters are not applicable. Classical methods are constrained by assumptions regarding e.g. the radar architecture or the bandwidth. However, these assumptions are not fulfilled by broadband radars. Hence, novel signal processing methods have to be developed, in order to exploit the full set of abilities provided by the radar system, as well as to tackle processing issues due to the radar itself. In this thesis, signal processing for a broadband FMCW MIMO radar operating in the mm-Wave frequency range will be outlined. The development of appropriate signal processing methods necessitates a paradigm change in treating radar. Apart from the classical perspective to radar, where the radar application of e.g. target recognition is the driving point, a different viewpoint will be considered here. Radar will be considered as a system identification application in the area of wireless propagation. A parametric model describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves in spatial, frequency and time domain. The respective parameters can be assigned to radar targets, and their evaluation can be used for target localisation. Hence, radar in conjunction with the estimation of target parameters will be treated as a model-based system identification problem. Model-based system identification from noisy measurements is a stochastic inverse problem. A variety of methods, which are highly flexible regarding the model, are known from literature. This flexibility enables the development of dedicated methods for radar signal processing, which are in accordance with the radar hardware and not inherently limited to a certain radar architecture or assumptions on e.g. the signal bandwidth. Therefore, the treatment of radar signal processing as model-based system identification is more suited to develop appropriate signal processing methods for the considered broadband FMCW MIMO radar.},
