	abstract = {With the development of science and technology, more accurate and stable location information can better serve peopleâ€™s lives. As people spend more time indoors, traditional positioning technologies such as Wi-Fi can no longer meet their needs due to a lack of positioning accuracy and interference resistance. UWB is an emerging positioning technology with high accuracy, robustness, and stability. This paper compares the advantages and disadvantages of UWB technology with those of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Common UWB geometric positioning methods such as TOA, TDOA, etc. are introduced. By introducing the latest research progress in UWB indoor positioning, an outlook on the future development of UWB indoor positioning is made. Compared with Bluetooth and other indoor positioning technologies, UWB positioning technology has the advantages of high positioning accuracy and good anti-interference. The UWB positioning system usually uses TOA, TDOA, AOA, and other positioning algorithms. In the future, UWB positioning technology will serve more and more complex positioning environments.},
