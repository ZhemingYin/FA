	abstract = {Intelligent mobile robots that can move independently were laid out in the real world around 100 years ago during the second world war after advancements in computer science. Since then, mobile robot research has transformed robotics and information engineering. For example, robots were crucial in military applications, especially in teleoperations, when they emerged during the second world war era. Furthermore, after the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in robotics, they became autonomous or more intelligent. Currently, mobile robots have been implemented in many applications like defense, security, freight, pattern recognition, medical treatment, mail delivery, infrastructure inspection and developments, passenger travel, and many more because they are more intelligent nowadays with artificial intelligence technology. To study the developments of mobile robots, we have studied an extensive literature survey of the last 50 years. In this article, we discuss a complete century of mobile robotics research, major sensors used in robotics, some major applications of mobile robots, and their impact on our lives and in applied engineering.},
